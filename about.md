Hi!

I'm Ara, I'm a (mainly python) programmer/software developer/engineer who is about to start trying REALLY REALLY hard to blog on the regular. I'm a Software Engineer (or Developer) at [OLX](https://tech.olx.com/), I'm also an ex-[dubizzler](https://www.dubizzle.com) and ex-[foobyte](http://foo.mobi).

I'm a HUGE fan of docker, especially for dev environments, and an IDE drone ~~trying to shift over to emacs with mixed success~~. I've worked with a fair variety of technologies, and will try to write about anything cool I come across.

### Contact me
You're welcome to contact me on linkedin or twitter. I'm not a huge user of the latter but do check in occasionally.
