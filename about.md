Hi!

I'm Ara, I'm a (mainly python) programmer/software developer/engineer who is about to start trying REALLY REALLY hard to blog on the regular. I'm also an ex-[foobyte](http://foo.mobi), ex-[dubizzler](https://www.dubizzle.com) and currently a student at the University of Southampton doing my MSc in Computer Science

I'm a HUGE fan of docker, especially for dev environments, and an IDE drone trying to shift over to emacs with mixed success (failure). I've worked with a fair variety of technologies, and will try to write about anything cool I come across.

You're welcome to contact me on linkedin or twitter. I'm not a huge user of the latter but do check in occasionally.
