title: A Good Reason to Buy whois Privacy
---

This is a quick post that I've intended to put together for a long time about what happens when you buy a domain without `whois` privacy.

When I set out to buy a new domain for a side-project I thought "oh yeah, it should totally be a non-issue to have whois info public, I'm not worried about public contact info". In hindsight I don't know why I thought this, because it turns out you're just asking for spam.

Shortly after buying the domain I started getting calls from random international numbers, eventually I picked up on one to see what's going on and got a lady asking me if I needed help doing website development. ugh.

Years later, my spam folder still receives terrible attempts at swaying me to buy professional web development services from companies unheard of. But I think I limited the damage buy adding on `whois` privacy within a day or so.
