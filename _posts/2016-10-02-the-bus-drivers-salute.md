title: The Bus Driver's Salute
---

The Bus Driver's Salute is what I call the wave that I've seen countless bus drivers
in many different countries give each other when passing in opposite directions on
their routes.

I first noticed it in [South Korea](https://www.flickr.com/photos/28588093@N00/albums/72157673084530072)
when the drivers would randomly raise their hands at almost regular intervals.
 I later noticed this was whenever another bus was passing.

After moving to Southampton in the UK, I noticed many of the drivers were
very cordial with each other, opening doors and windows to chat at red lights,
flashing their hi-beams at each other if passing at night or simply waving while 
crossing paths.

It's an awesome way to keep a human touch when it would be so easy to 
drift away from it.
